<H1>Protein Classification Methods

Three different protein classification model has been discussed. 
1. <b>Sequence identity model:</b> uses protein sequences to find the similiar protein sequences and we know that, similiar sequences tend to have similiar functions. I used USEARCH. One can use it through linux command line. 

2. <b> HMM Model:</b> Instead of finding similiar sequences, HMM builts a profile of similiar sequences. I used HMMER to built the HMM profile. One can use it through linux command line. 

3. <b> Decision Tree model: </b>. Extract feature variables using protein sequences such as amino acid composition, hydrophobicity index, molecular weight etc to generate a dataset and predict the function of unknown protein sequences.
