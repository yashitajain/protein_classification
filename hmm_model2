MODEL2. Building Hidden Markov Model using HMMER(LINUX COMMAND LINE):
 
  A. Building HMM Profile using training set. To use hmmbuild, we will need MSA of the training sequences.

                        hmmbuild target.hmm target1.stockholm

 B. Compress the profile database into binary compression and indexing of the flatfiles. 

                      hmmpress target.hmm

C. Searching the database sequence against the HMM Profile.

                      hmmsearch --domE 1e-5 --domtblout hmmprofile_result.csv --noali target.hmm sg_putative_10000.faa
